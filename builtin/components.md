# Components

## Built-in Components

> The documentations of this section is still working in progress. Before that, you can take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev/blob/main/packages/client/builtin) directly.

### `Toc`

Insert a Table Of Content.

If you want a slide to not appear in the `<Toc>` component, you can use in the front matter block of the slide:
```yml
---
hideInToc: true
---
```

Titles are displayed using the [`<Titles>` component](#titles)

#### Usage

~~~md
<Toc />
~~~

Parameters:

* `columns` (`string | number`, default: `1`): The number of columns of the display
* `listClass` (`string | string[]`, default: `''`): Classes to apply to the table of contents list
* `maxDepth` (`string | number`, default: `Infinity`): The maximum depth level of title to display
* `minDepth` (`string | number`, default: `1`): The minimum depth level of title to display
* `mode` (`'all' | 'onlyCurrentTree'| 'onlySiblings'`, default: `'all'`):
  * `'all'`: Display all items
  * `'onlyCurrentTree'`: Display only items that are in current tree (active item, parents and children of active item)
  * `'onlySiblings'`: Display only items that are in current tree and their direct siblings

### `Link`

Insert a link you can use to navigate to a given slide.

#### Usage

~~~md
<Link to="42">Go to slide 42</Link>
<Link to="42" title="Go to slide 42"/>
~~~

Parameters:

* `to` (`string | number`): The path of the slide to navigate to (slides starts from `1`)
* `title` (`string`): The title to display

### `Titles`

Insert the main title from a slide parsed as HTML.

Titles and title levels get automatically retrieved from the first title element of each slides.

You can override this automatic behaviour for a slide by using the front matter syntax:
```yml
---
title: Amazing slide title
level: 2
---
```

#### Usage

The `<Titles>` component is a virtual component you can import with:
```js
import Titles from '/@slidev/titles.md'
```

Then you can use it with:
~~~md
<Titles no="42" />
~~~

Parameters:

* `no` (`string | number`): The number of the slide to display the title from (slides starts from `1`)

## Custom Components

Create a directory `components/` under your project root, and simply put your custom Vue components under it, then you can use it with the same name in your markdown file!

Read more in the [Customization](/custom/directory-structure#components) section.

## Theme-provided Components

Themes can provide components as well. Please read their documentations for what they have provided.

Check more in the [directory structure](/custom/directory-structure) section.
